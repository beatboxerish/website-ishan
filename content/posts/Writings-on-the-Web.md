I have been writing on the web since a while. It’s out there. Though never took time to collate it all in one specific 
place. When these writings take place depends on my idea of free time and emotional state at a given point in time. I
keep fluctuating between different states of what I think I should be doing with time in general and my writing bears
the brunt.

Below are the spaces where I usually end up writing:

* My extremely vulnerable side is displayed on my [Tumblr account](https://www.tumblr.com/ishisgettingtired) with super 
short prose/poems (i don’t know what you actually call them haha).
* My tech, conservation, and productive sides take over when I am writing on Substack, either through my 
personal blog, [ReefBuilder](https://reefbuilder.substack.com/), or through 
[Coastal Impact’s blog](https://coastalimpactindia.substack.com/).
* Finally, general musings which I don’t expect people to chance upon, take interest in, or just simply care about, 
are put up on display on this website itself, [right here](https://beatboxerish.github.io/posts/).
